Integrate with other django apps? 
Better to use default authentication + extend

Otherwise - I'm subclassing AbstractBaseUser

email required?
log in with email? 
log in with username is django admin default

reason - usernames are not secure (not that emails are either)

upgrade from token auth to oauth2
